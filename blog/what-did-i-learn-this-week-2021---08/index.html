<li><strong>Adam Curtis</strong> - I came to know about this British documentary film maker recently, when his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Get_You_Out_of_My_Head_(TV_series)">new documentary</a> released. He has a unique style of making and his subjects are unconventional. His documentaries are available in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamCurtisDocumentary">youtube channel</a>. I didn't get time to watch it, but need to do that soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://atap.google.com/jacquard/">Jacquard By Google</a> is a platform for embedding sensors and feedback devices in fabrics and clothing in ways that seem natural and comfortable.  In one basic use-case, users can provide input to a mobile phone by touching or stroking the garment in a designated location. Honestly I'm not impressed by this tech and my thoughts are perfectly summed up by someone in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26162710">HN comment</a>.</li>
