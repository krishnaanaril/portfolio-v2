User credentials are validated with Azure AD to generate access tokens UI calls Power BI API to get the report specific data with the token. Power BI API returns report data, and UI displays it in the web page.) for more details.</p>\n<p>Here we need to do few more steps than what is mentioned in the documentation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Redirect URL should be the URL in the application that should be displayed post user authentication.</li>\n<li>Set the key ‘oauth2AllowImplicitFlow’ in Azure Active Directory app manifest to true as we are using browser based clients.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Set up your Power BI environment</h3>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embed-sample-for-your-organization#set-up-your-power-bi-environment\">this</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3>Create Angular client</h3>\n<p>Our application should authenticate user to Azure Active Directory (AD) and generate the access token. This access token is used as the <a href=\"https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/\">bearer </a>token for subsequent Power BI API requests.</p>\n<p>For authenticating with Azure AD, we’ll be using <a href=\"https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js\">this</a> library. You can add this to your angular project by running the following command.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> adal-angular\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In the HTML page, create a ‘div’ with id ‘embedReport’. We’ll be showing report in this div. Embedding in div is done using Power BI JavaScript <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript\">library</a>. You can add it to your angular application by running the following command.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--save</span> powerbi-client\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now we’ve added the additional libraries for your requirement and can we start coding the the authentication service as follows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/02_02.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n<em>Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/9a07c99efe7db86b8ede17d4177be303</em></p>\n<p>We can store ‘adal’ related configuration in the environment.ts file. I’ve attached the sample format below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/02_03.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n<em>Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/b1b8798373a6bbe42e7f288ceb9ca1a9</em></p>\n<p>Once the user is authenticated, to handle callback you need to add the following code in the redirect component’s ngOnInit method.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/02_04.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Here I’ve written the code to embed the first of the available reports to a user. You can update it to suit your needs. First we need to get the access token and get the first of the available reports. The code is as follows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/02_05.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n<em>Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/398f8e51136e649bf35e41baf8367efe</em></p>\n<p>The method ‘getReportsInGroup’ will be invoking the corresponding Power BI REST API.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/02_06.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n<em>Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/427e4ef6b171fa109787617b3c0e6953</em></p>\n<p>Next, we need to embed the report in the HTML page. This is similar to ‘Embed for your customers’, except the token type which is ‘Aad’ and access token instead of embed token. Embedding report code is as follows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/02_06.png\" alt=\"Embedding report for your organization\">\r\n<em>Embedding report for your organization</em></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Now you’re done with your Angular app, run it and verify the reports. Dashboards and Tiles can be embedded in a similar way. You can find those snippets here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/1392403aa328684738e4ed6f0b8a664f\">Dashboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/211f5b390a5e7e038b7a67dfe387fb29\">Tile</a></li>\n</ul>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
