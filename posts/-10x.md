Today I read a very interesting blog post titled 'How to be a -10x Engineer' written by [Taylor](https://taylor.town/about). It's discussion in hacker news was so boring and cliched at the same time. Everyone has seen this mythical -10x engineer in their career, but none of them commented whether they've shown any of these traits. For me that blog looked like a perfect checklist to do some self-review.
