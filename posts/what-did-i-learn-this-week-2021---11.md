1. [**Survivorship bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias): It is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.
2. **[Postpartum psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_psychosis)**: It was recognized that severe mental illness sometimes started abruptly in the days after childbirth, later known as **puerperal** or **postpartum psychosis**. Came to know about this with a [recent news](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2021/mar/10/kollam-woman-in-depression-strangles-baby-girl-to-death-2274520.html).
3. Read a bit about [Hadoop](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/hadoop/what-is-hadoop/), to have an overview. Hadoop consists of four main modules:
    - Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
    - Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN)
    - MapReduce
    - Hadoop Common
4. [Git merge quirks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33569970/1520750) - If you're already in conflicted state, and you want to just accept all of theirs:
```bash
git checkout --theirs .
git add .
```
5. [Backpressure](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/backpressure.html) involves strategies to control the observables that produce items more rapidly than their observers can consume.
6. The **Pareto principle** states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. Other names for this principle are the **80/20 rule**, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.
7. **Big Wave Surfing**: While randomly surfing youtube videos, I saw a video of surfing in Teahupoo, Tahiti, French Polynesia. This got my interest and started watching some more videos. Then I came to know about the [biggest waves](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-best-big-wave-surf-spots-in-the-world) in the world. [Some of them](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/02/nazare-in-portugal-is-the-home-to-the-worlds-biggest-waves-and-bravest-surfers) are in my bucket list and I'm planning to visit them soon.
8. Watched [Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA) by [Robert Sapolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky)
    - Frontal lobotomy: A lobotomy, or leucotomy, is a form of psychosurgery, a neurosurgical treatment of a mental disorder that involves severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex.
    - [Konrad Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Lorenz): He is often regarded as one of the founders of modern ethology, the study of animal behavior.
    - Book suggestion: [Chaos by James Gleick](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=james+gleick+chaos)
