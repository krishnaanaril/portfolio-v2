Since firefox by default (Can be enabled by **browser.send_pings** flag) do not support ping attribute Google does link mangling to make a redirect causing it difficult for a user to copy link from the search result. It can be avoided by a [simple javascript](https://gist.github.com/radiantly/e1c7319214c77fa007f323fc56cd0239).
