1. **Adam Curtis** - I came to know about this British documentary film maker recently, when his [new documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Get_You_Out_of_My_Head_(TV_series)) released. He has a unique style of making and his subjects are unconventional. His documentaries are available in his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamCurtisDocumentary). I didn't get time to watch it, but need to do that soon.
2. [Jacquard By Google](https://atap.google.com/jacquard/) is a platform for embedding sensors and feedback devices in fabrics and clothing in ways that seem natural and comfortable.  In one basic use-case, users can provide input to a mobile phone by touching or stroking the garment in a designated location. Honestly I'm not impressed by this tech and my thoughts are perfectly summed up by someone in the [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26162710).
3. [Jacquard Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine): The Jacquard machine is a device fitted to a loom that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with such complex patterns as brocade, damask and matelass√©.The resulting ensemble of the loom and Jacquard machine is then called a Jacquard loom. The machine was invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804.
4. [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/) is a documentation tool for Angular applications. It generates a static documentation of your application.
5. **Olx wasn't an Indian company.** Damn, I don't know how I got that idea but until last week i was considering olx as an indian company. Recently I watched a video related to AWS presented by Olx engineers and to my surprise they weren't Indians and I googled the company for the first time. OnLine eXchange also known as OLX Group is a **Dutch-domiciled online marketplace** headquartered in Amsterdam, and owned by **Prosus**, the international assets division of **Naspers**, founded in 2006 and operating in 45 countries.
6. **Teller**: A bank teller is an employee of a bank who deals directly with customers. In some places, this employee is known as a cashier or customer representative. 
7. [Variable Reward](https://designli.co/blog/a-deep-dive-on-variable-rewards-and-how-to-use-them/): Variable reward (or unpredictable reward or variable schedule reward) is reward delivered intermittently. The reinforcement schedule is often designed to maximize behavior. Three Types of Variable Rewards:
    - Rewards of the Tribe
    - Rewards of the Hunt
    - Rewards of the Self
