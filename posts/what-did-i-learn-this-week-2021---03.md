1. The use of [Form 12BB](https://cleartax.in/s/guide-to-form-12bb#form). The Form 12BB is the form that you fill and give to your employer - not to the Income Tax Department - so that your employer can figure how much income tax is to be deducted from your monthly pay.

2. Birds have a semi transparent eyelid that protects their eyes while flying. [Nictitating membrane of birds](https://www.howitworksdaily.com/mythbuster-do-birds-have-eyelids/). I learned about this while watching a video from the youtube channel 'Daily Dose of Internet'

5. In physics, the [n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem) is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally. The [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) is a special case of n-body problem and there is a famous 
[Chinese novel series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) associated with it.

6. Came to know about [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), the founder of [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) and his [blog](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html).

7. LGTM acronym [found](https://github.com/angular/components/pull/21542) in Github stands for 'Looks Good To Me.'

8. People donate more to charity when they know a single victim’s story, versus statistics of a thousand deaths. It’s called the [Identifiable Victim Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect).

9. A [hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor), also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. The machine on which VMs are created is called host machine and the created machines are called guest machines.
