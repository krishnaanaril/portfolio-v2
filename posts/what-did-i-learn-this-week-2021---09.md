1. Refreshed my knowledge of Indian traffic signs from the site [indianauto.com](https://indianauto.com/tips/indian-traffic-signs-with-their-meanings-nid6445).
2. 21 smart [SEO tips](https://moz.com/blog/21-seo-tips-2021) for 2021. I've implemented most of them in my personal site.
3. [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) is a library for the implementation of 'Mediator' pattern in dotnet. I've blogged about it a [two part series](https://krishnamohan.dev/blog/how-to-implement-cqrs-with-mediat-r---part-1).
4. Difference between x64 and ARM 64 from a Quora [Answer](https://qr.ae/pNQ9b7).Though the differences are bit blurred nowadays, ARM64 is a 64 bit chipset for mobile and portable devices with less energy consumption and low performance. On the other hand x64 is a 64 bit chipset based on x86 architecture for high performance computing.
5. [`in` parameter modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/in-parameter-modifier#limitations-on-in-parameters): This feature was introduced in **C# 7.2**. Decreasing the cost of passing larger structs is the motivating scenario for the feature. More details can be found in an [SO discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52820372/why-would-one-ever-use-the-in-parameter-modifier-in-c) on the same topic.
6. Use of [CancellationToken](https://andrewlock.net/using-cancellationtokens-in-asp-net-core-mvc-controllers/). This was a new feature for me and I did a poc on it. You can read about its implementation in by [blog post](https://krishnamohan.dev/blog/how-to-implement-cqrs-with-mediat-r---part-2).
7. [notiz.dev](https://notiz.dev/) is a beautiful blog developed with Angular, Scully and Tailwind. This week I've removed material libraries from my personal site and switched to Tailwind. I've shamelessly copied a lot of good practices from the [source code](https://github.com/notiz-dev/notiz) of **notiz.dev**.
8. [utterances ](https://utteranc.es/) is a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. This is one of the innovative use cases of an existing, fool-proof system. Need to add it to my blog soon.
