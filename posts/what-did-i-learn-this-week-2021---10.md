1. [**Storybookjs**](https://storybook.js.org/): Learned about this new tool to develop components for angular in isolation. It uses [compodoc](https://compodoc.app/) under the hood.
2. **How to [mock public methods](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56905918/1520750) of a class with Moq.** Moq creates an implementation of the mocked type. If the type is an interface, it creates a class that implements the interface. If the type is a class, it creates an inherited class, and the members of that inherited class call the base class. But in order to do that it has to override the members. If a class has members that can't be overridden (they aren't virtual, abstract) then Moq can't override them to add its own behaviors.
3. Came to know about the agriculture company named [Olam International](https://www.olamgroup.com/). Its cofounder and current CEO is a keralite named Sunny George Varghese.
4. [**Kumbukkal black pepper**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTrl5ZVTXiA) is a variety of black pepper patented to Idukki farmer KT Varghese.
5. [**Gyroscopic Effect**](https://qr.ae/pNLpEx) is ability (tendency) of the rotating body to maintain a steady direction of its axis of rotation. Examples include the movement of shuttlecock and [bullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkFzT9dDB20).
