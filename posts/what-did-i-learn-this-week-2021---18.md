1. [Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/): Googleâ€™s Consistent, Global Authorization System. Zanzibar scales to trillions of access control lists (ACL) and millions of authN requests per second. Airbnb's [Himeji](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/himeji-a-scalable-centralized-system-for-authorization-at-airbnb-341664924574) and [Ory/Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto/) are based on this.
2. [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) is a DNS server program, written in C++ and licensed under the GPL. It was founded by [Bert Hubert](https://berthub.eu/) in 1999
3. Read one thought provoking [article](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/how-tech-loses-out/) by [Bert Hubert](https://berthub.eu/). Learned that Philips is a dutch company.
4. Learned the use of spoiler by watching a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXjiThF1LXU). HN link about how [engines](https://ciechanow.ski/internal-combustion-engine/) work put me in to this.
5. Math.round() in js round towards positive infinity. e.g.: -102.5 is -101 instead of -103.
6. Learned about [Cognitive biases](https://growth.design/psychology/) and Principles.
7. Learned about the [history](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15184612/1520750) of couchbase and couchdb.
