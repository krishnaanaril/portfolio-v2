- Attended an online workshop about Gothic Calligraphy organised by [Prajwal Xavier](https://www.instagram.com/prajwalxavier/) and it was worth the effort. He provided lot of workesheets and a set of basic tools for doing calligraphy. It was a two hour workshop over the weekend and it really helped to understand the basics.
- [Google docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html) are using canvas based rendering.
- [Houdini](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Houdini) is a set of low-level APIs that exposes parts of the CSS engine, giving developers the power to extend CSS by hooking into the styling and layout process of a browserâ€™s rendering engine. The [Houdini task force](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/05/houdini) consists of engineers from Mozilla, Apple, Opera, Microsoft, HP, Intel and Google working together to expose certain parts of the CSS engine to web developers.
