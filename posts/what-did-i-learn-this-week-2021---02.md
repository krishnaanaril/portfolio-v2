1. Watched the Scott Wlashin talk - [The Functional Programming Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrp_LZ-XGsY) and I got a high level understanding of Monad, Monoid, Functor and Effects.
2. I came to know that largest terrestial vehicle is a German made '[Bagger 288](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagger_288)' whose construction is completed in 1978.
3. There is a [deep learning based ai tool](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/colorizer) for colorizing old images, and it is working pretty good with my given samples. Source code of this tool is available in [github](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify).
4. I was browsing reddit and reading old CIA/KGB jokes. From one of the jokes I learned that the elite police tactical unit of France is known as [GIGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIGN).
5. Learned about the reason behind the two google outages happend in 14th December, 2020. It is summarised in my [blog post](https://krishnamohan.dev/blog/understanding-google-outages).
6. If you want to take a back up of your data in Google services:
    - Go to [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com/);
    - Select the services and click next
    - Choose file type, frequency and destination
    - Click export

    When the files are ready you'll get an email with download link.
