- [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) - The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. The protocol usually runs over TCP/IP; however, any network protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections can support MQTT. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The protocol is an open OASIS standard and an ISO recommendation (ISO/IEC 20922).

- Researchers working in Israel have identified a previously [unknown type of ancient human](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57586315) that lived alongside our species more than 100,000 years ago. The finds consist of a partial skull and jaw from an individual who lived between 140,000 and 120,000 years ago. The scientists have named the newly discovered lineage the **"Nesher Ramla Homo type"**.
