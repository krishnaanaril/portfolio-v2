1. Read a [nice book](https://fifty.user-interface.io/50_ui_tips.pdf) about UX design tips written by [Victor](https://twitter.com/vponamariov). It is a collection of tweets than a book, but very helpful.
2. Learned about [Cognitive Load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load).
3. Found a [Teach Yourself Demoscene](https://github.com/psenough/teach_yourself_demoscene_in_14_days) repository. I haven't heard about this before. The [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations.
4. China uses a different geographic coordinate system than the rest of the world. [WGS-84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) is the most common coordinate system, but China uses [GCJ-02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China#GCJ-02), sometimes called Mars Coordinates. Part of GCJ-02 is an algorithm that obfuscates the results. So applying any GCJ-02 coordinate to a globe using WGS-84 coordinates gets distorted like a funhouse mirror. Found this info in [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27187915).
5. [Project Starline](https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/) is an experimental video communication method currently in development by Google that allows the user to see a 3D model of the person they are communicating with. My first thought was that it looks like how people communicate with inmates in US prisons.
