1. [Candling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candling) is a method used in embryology to study the growth and development of an embryo inside an egg. A youtube shorts video helped me to learn this.
2. [Jerusalem syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_syndrome) is a group of mental phenomena involving the presence of religiously-themed obsessive ideas, delusions, or other psychosis-like experiences that are triggered by a visit to the city of Jerusalem. The religious focus of Jerusalem syndrome distinguishes it from other phenomena, such as [Stendhal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stendhal_syndrome) in Florence or [Paris syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome) in Paris. 
3. While trying to learn system design, I found a very good technical blog by [Tian Pan](https://tianpan.co/)
4. Learned about 39 cloud [design patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/).
5. Bulkhead: [One](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead) of the 39 cloud pattern is named after the [bulkhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulkhead_(partition)) of ships. A bulkhead is an upright wall within the hull of a ship or within the fuselage of an aeroplane.

8. There are [5 Pontoon bridges](https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/163111/what-is-this-bridge-over-the-suez-canal) over Suez Canal. A [pontoon bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontoon_bridge) (or ponton bridge), also known as a floating bridge, uses floats or shallow-draft boats to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel. The buoyancy of the supports limits the maximum load they can carry.
