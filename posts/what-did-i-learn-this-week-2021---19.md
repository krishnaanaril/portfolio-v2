1. Read a research [paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2009/2009.02114.pdf) about **'Authentication and Authorization in micro-services based systems: Survey of architecture patterns'** while researching about xacml and [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/). The third architecture mentioned in the paper is similar to [Netflix's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6tUNpRpdnY) architecture for authorization based on OPA/
2. Learned some new [html tips](https://markodenic.com/html-tips/). Some of the tips were already aware, but some were really new to me.
3. Found the [API setu](https://apisetu.gov.in/public/api/cowin#/) for Cowin and created a [wrapper PWA](https://cowin-helper.krishnamohan.dev/) around it.
4. Learned about Couchbase concepts and did some poc with its [dotnet sdk](https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/hello-world/overview.html).
5. Learned how to [validate an indian pin](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33865555/1520750) input.
6. Watched a video by [Kunal Shah, CEO of Cred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4px19xzK7zI). I really liked his concept around **'delta of efficency'**.
