- Found a good offline first database [comparison](https://github.com/pubkey/client-side-databases).
- [Wikipedia - Blind Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) helps to pull up a random page when you are bored.
- Facebook renamed to [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/meta/).
- [PwaBuilder.com](https://blog.pwabuilder.com/posts/publish-your-pwa-to-the-ios-app-store/) is a new tool that helps to build iOs apps from PWAs
- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system.  DuckDB is a regular RDBMS that has persistent ACID storage, but is tuned towards analytical workloads, i.e. read-heavy workloads with aggregates that require full scans of the data. Any data you write to tables is stored persistently on disk, and not all your data needs to fit in memory either.
- [OpenWorm](https://openworm.org/) is an open source project dedicated to creating the first virtual organism in a computer.
