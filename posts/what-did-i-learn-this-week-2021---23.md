1. Came to know about [threejs](https://threejs.org/), a javascript 3D library. Also found its angular wrapper - [angular-three](https://github.com/nartc/angular-three). Saw [one of the site](https://www.oculus.com/medal-of-honor/) developed using threejs and it was freaking awesome. I need to try it, but right now I don't have time for it.
2. [Stack Overflow Sold to Tech Giant Prosus for $1.8 Billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-developer-community-stack-overflow-sold-to-tech-giant-prosus-for-1-8-billion-11622648400). Not sure it is a good thing or bad thing. When Microsoft bought GitHub I was bit skeptical, but it turn out to be okay. Hoping that this change won't bring any breaking changes to the StackOverflow usage.
3. [Mandala Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala): A mandala is a geometric configuration of symbols. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a sacred space and as an aid to meditation and trance induction. In the Eastern religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Shintoism it is used as a map representing deities, or specially in the case of Shintoism, paradises, kami or actual shrines.
4. [Mastershot App](https://mastershot.app/) is an online video editor, that helps us to edit videos in the browser and it is free.
5. Learned some [C++ tricks](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/15643) that may help me in the Codeforces contests.
