- Airbus has completed test flights for its [solar-powered Zephyr](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2021/10/solar-powered-aircraft-flown-for-nearly-three-weeks-without-landing/) aircraft which is designed to stay airborne for weeks at a time in order to provide internet to users on the ground.
- In 1958 two guys flew a Cessna 172 nonstop for [64 days without landing](https://jalopnik.com/how-a-slot-machine-mechanic-flew-150-000-miles-over-64-5971433). They refueled mid-air via a truck that drove under them during a low pass.
- Found a [blog](https://whitehoodhacker.net/posts/2021-10-04-the-big-rick) that depicts the details of hacking IoT systems (for educational purposes). Learned about the term [RickRolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) too.
- Found a [blog](https://mdk.fr/blog/how-apt-does-its-fancy-progress-bar.html) on the alternate implemenation of putting progressbar at the bottom of command line similar to apt installation. [`tqdem`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/) is a Fast, Extensible Progress Bar for Python and CLI.
