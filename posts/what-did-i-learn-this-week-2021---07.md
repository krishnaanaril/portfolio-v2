1. Author of famous [NewtonSoft.json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) is a kiwi(?) named [James Newton-King](https://twitter.com/JamesNK)
2. [Bear Spray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_spray) is a specific aerosol bear deterrent, whose active ingredients are capsaicin and related capsaicinoids, that is used to deter aggressive or charging bears.
3. Chimerism: Recently I read about the case of a failed dna test in [time magazine](https://time.com/4091210/chimera-twins/). Chimeras are animals or humans that contain the cells of two or more individuals. Their bodies contain two different sets of DNA.
4. Difference between slug and snail is that snails have hard protective external shells. Previously I thought both were same.
5. [Tapas](https://tapas.io/) & [Webtoons](https://www.webtoons.com/en/) are two popular web comics sites. I was thinking of creating a web comic platform with interface similar to whatsapp status.
6. [Comicgen](https://gramener.com/comicgen) is a site to generate comic avatars based on a set of selectable inputs.
