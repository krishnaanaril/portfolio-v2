# A failed app idea and some new learnings

Last week while browsing hacker news, I came across a discussion on [Spotify and podcasts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34793116). There i saw few features users requested in podcasts app and thought of create a new one to address few of those issues. Amoung those the major feature i liked and want to implement is the transcript feature. I really liked the concept of showing captions/subtitles similar to music lyrics in spotfiy app.
